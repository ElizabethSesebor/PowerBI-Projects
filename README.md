## Project Summary

This dashboard provides insights into bike purchase rates across Europe, North America, and the Pacific region. The data indicates that North America leads with over 50% of bike purchases among the three countries.

The surveyed population consists of 1000 individuals, with a gender distribution of 51% male and 49% female. Males tend to cover longer distances on bikes compared to females. Regarding demographics, professionals with a Bachelor's Degree, earning an average of approximately 10 million dollars, exhibit a heightened interest in bike purchases. This group predominantly falls within the 31-50 age range, and there is a notable prevalence of married individuals.

In summary, the analysis reveals that well-educated, high-earning, and married individuals are particularly inclined towards bike riding, likely due to their ability to afford the associated lifestyle in terms of time, money, and enthusiasm.
